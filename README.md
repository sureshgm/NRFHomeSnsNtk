# NRFHomeSnsNtk
This code is to build home automation using the arduino library provided in https://www.mysensors.org/
the ESP8266 code connects a NRF24L01+ and acts as a wifi gate-way
The sensor node is built using hardware from forcetronics 
The sensor code uses dimmer as a sensor 
the above is tested with mysensor controller for switch press - turn ON light, swith press turn OFF light.
The drawback of this implementation is dependency of gateway and a computer to run home automation controller.
